Real-Estate-Price-Prediction ( Pune )

Description:
In this project, I built a Real Estate Price Prediction System for properties in the Pune region using machine learning, particularly XGBoost, which is known for its high accuracy in regression tasks.

Key Features:

Modeling: The model predicts real estate prices based on multiple factors such as the square meters of the area, locality, number of BHKs, and other relevant attributes.
Data Collection and Preprocessing: I gathered data from various sources and performed preprocessing tasks such as handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables like localities.
XGBoost: I chose XGBoost for this project because of its ability to handle large datasets efficiently and provide high accuracy. Hyperparameter tuning was done to improve model performance further.
Challenges:

A key challenge was handling non-linear relationships between the features (e.g., locality vs. price), which XGBoost's decision-tree-based approach handled effectively.
Another challenge was ensuring the model was not overfitting, for which I used techniques like cross-validation and early stopping.
